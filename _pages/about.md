Hi! I am Dayoon Suh.

<!-- I am Robotics MSE student at University of Pennsylvania. Prior to my MSE, I was an undergraduate at Purdue University, where I double majored Data Science and Applied Statistics. During my undergraduate studies, I was advised by Prof. Byung-Cheol Min. 
My research interests lie in building intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and interact with their surroundings in a human-like manner.  -->
I am an MSE Robotics student at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Prof. Naida Figueroa. Before Penn, I double majored in Data Science and Applied Statistics at Purdue University, where I was advised by Prof. Byung-Cheol Min.
I’m interested in building embodied systems that can perceive and understand their surroundings, reason about what to do next, and execute actions reliably - especially for long-horizon, multi-step tasks.
<!-- I am a undergraduate student majoring in Data Science and Applied Statistics at Purdue University, advised by Prof. Byung-Cheol Min. 
My primary research interests lie in the intersection of computer vision, multimodal learning, and robot perception. Particularly, I am interested in enabling robots to perceive, reason, and interact with their surroundings in a human-like manner. In general, I am excited about the potential applications of AI in solving real-world problems. -->
