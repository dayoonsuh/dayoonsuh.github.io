Hi! I am Dayoon Suh.

I am a senior majoring in Data Science and Applied Statistics at Purdue University. My primary research interests are in computer vision, multimodal learning, and robotics. I am excited about the potential applications of AI in solving real-world problems.

Outside of my academic work, I enjoy photography and cooking, which allow me to explore creativity and relax.
